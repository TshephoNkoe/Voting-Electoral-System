Blockchain Voting System 🗳️🔗
A decentralized, transparent, and secure voting platform powered by blockchain technology.

Overview
This voting system leverages blockchain to ensure tamper-proof elections, voter anonymity, and real-time result verification. Built with Solidity for smart contracts and a modern frontend framework (e.g., React/Next.js), it aims to eliminate electoral fraud and increase trust in democratic processes.

Key Features
Smart Contracts (/contracts):

Secure voting logic with role-based access (admin/voter).

Immutable ballot recording on the blockchain.

Time-bound elections with start/end constraints.

Frontend (/frontend):

User-friendly interface for voter registration, ballot casting, and result tracking.

Wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect) for blockchain interactions.

Testing (/test):

Comprehensive unit/integration tests for contract reliability.

Simulated attack vectors to ensure robustness.

Deployment (/ignition/modules, /scripts):

Modular deployment scripts for Ethereum or EVM-compatible chains.

Automated contract verification on block explorers.

Technical Stack
Blockchain: Ethereum (or EVM-compatible chains)

Smart Contracts: Solidity, Hardhat (see hardhat.config.js)

Testing: Chai, Mocha, Waffle

Frontend: React/Next.js, Ethers.js, Web3.js

Tools: Git, GitHub, npm (see package.json)

Why Blockchain for Voting?
Transparency: Every vote is recorded on-chain, auditable by anyone.

Security: Cryptographic encryption prevents tampering.

Accessibility: Decentralized access reduces reliance on centralized authorities.
